				<h2>Day - 1</h2>
				<h5>Round 1 & 2, June 25, 2019</h5>
				
				<p>Hii!! This is My First Interview Experience Blog..!!</p><br>
				
				<p>I was really excited and happy that I started to write my first Blog and it was My First Interview Experience @Zilker Technology.</p><br>
				
				<p>I had an idea to write a blog since from my 2nd year. But I couldn't make it off. I'll continue my personal in another blog and come lets start and thanks for joining with me here!!</p><br>
				
				<p>That day on (25/06/2019) started as usual we were came late, so we didn't attend the ppt session. I was sitting near Krishna square and chitchat with my friends, later the session ended we moved to the labs and the drive started..</p><br>
				
				<p>At First there were quant's apti(10), Technical apti(30), Programming Questions(2) for a total of 1hr 15min. I do completed all the questions and by solving 1 program successfully. We came out and discussed about how guys done!!. But many people said that didn't except Myself ad Narain. We gone to have breakfast.</p><br>

				<p>We people moving to write face test and results came. We both got <strong>"Selected for the 2nd round"</strong>. I was really happy that I'm gonna attend a Tech-Interview for the first time after got rejected from the prevoius companies in first round.</p><br>

				<p>It took 4.30hrs to complete the 2nd round and I was afraid and a bit nervous that how I'm gonna speak there inside the interview. Later my name was called I gone into the room and It took 3-4[min] to make myself comfortable then the interviewer started with My Favourite Domains. I said more about Android and he asked to me to write a piece of code (a simple form process to get and display the text into the next page) I wrote the java and xml code and explained it clearly. Later he started asking me about my projects that i have mentioned in the resume. I said one by one and I showed my personal app installed in my mobile, he replied "COOL".</p><br>

				<p>Later he started asking questions on java, data structures, problem solving and the domains which I was interested with. Then he moved to behavioural questions and puzzles and ended with a smart question of "Do U wanna ask anything to me?", I replied boldly the I didn't attend morning ppt session so can u please share me that and I asked about the company workculture, he replied clearly and I came out then moved to room and shared my experience with all people in the room and I found some mistakes that I have done there and I thought by changing the way I speak, and a small doubt that I won't move to next round and later the results came and <strong>"I was one amoung the 12"</strong>.</p><br>

				<h2>Day - 2</h2>
				<h5>Round 3, June 26, 2019</h5>

				<p> The next day (26/06/2019) I woke up early and started preparing for the tech-group discussion. I gathered more information from people who got into the company already and from my friends. Later I was inside the office for interview. They tested our Problem Solving skills by giving 3 questions that has to be solved within 1[hr] time. I completed 2 among from 3. We everyone waiting next to the panel room.</p><br>

				<p> I was called as the first person. By getting inside there are not 2 or 3 people inside rather than 7. They started asking me questions on what I have solved in the paper & pen round, I explained clearly about my approach and the logic that I have used and later questions raiesed entirely from my Resume about family, domains specific, stress testing, behavioural questions and some personal talks about my knowledge about their company. I Learned Lots and Lots of things from that session that seems to be an [Ice-Breaking]. Some questions that made me to ask them { Oh God!! why can't you change the question comes in my mind!!}. And some questions made me to think the {Past, Present, Future} to put me in that situation to answer those related questions. Some questions made me to know who I'm. It took 40-50[min] to complete that session. Then the results came by evening 6 and I was not among the 7 selects. </p><br>

				<p>I shared this experience with my friends so that I can come to know the mistakes that I have done, so that I'll change and upgrade myself for the upcomings..</p><br>

				<p>Thanks for spending your time and happy to share!! 	Have a great day :)</p><br>
